# setting up for vite and svelte and page

we don't want to use `sveltekit` for no reason other than we would rather have a full window over the project rather than "magic"

`npm create vite` choose `svelte` as an option and typescript.

that should then scaffold out a project.

add the tot dojo app as a submodule

`git submodule add  git@github.com:ArchetypalTech/TheOrugginTrail-DoJo.git tot-dojo`

make sure the project has an `asdf` toolchain
