## Personas
### Person A: (researcher)
- Goal: Find information like the producer and release year of the Mario Bros Movie

### Person B: (fanfiction)
- Goal: Look for fanfictions crossing the animated series Hazbin Hotel with the Lackadaisy animated pilot. Might be willing to contribute a fanfiction the future.
- Limitations: Reluctant to create yet another account.

### Person C: (gig economy)
- Goal: Make some money by doing bounties on Bridge Builder. 
- Background: Professional 2D artist looking for work, annoyed by AI.
- Limitations: Wants some inspiration from the client and avoid miss communications leading to declined bounty payments. 

### Person D: (fan)
- Goal: Looking for a professional 3D render of a comic figure to use it as a background for their PC. 
- Limitations: Willing to spend some money, but picky on the results.

### Person E: (farmer/troll)
- Goal: Make some money by fulfilling bounties with minimum effort work.
- Background: Self proclaimed exploiter and internet troll, looking for some easy money.

### Person F: (day job)
- Goal: Get someone to continue working on their ideas and hope for potential royalty payments.
- Background: 3D concept artist and world builder, used to post pictures of their world on social media, now looking for someone to make more out of their ideas.
- Limitations: Time constraints don't allow for further participation on the subject, the "world" to build upon was set up loosely and is missing important connections.

### Person G: (shallow remixer)
- Goal: Create and publish a artwork while reusing the assets of a game found on bridgebuilder.  Aims to fulfil a bounty with their work.
- Background: 2D pixel art artist
- Limitations: Hates to read licences, especially since they have to look through all of the assets they used to create the artwork. Does not want to spend too long in uploading the assets, primarily interested in sharing and finding assets and inspiration.

### Person H: (timeline canon fan)
- Goal: Find out about the evolution of Anakin Skywalker over the star wars movies. Darth Vader is interesting as well, but there is no interest in the Series Clone Wars or any other media apart from the main movies. And since Star Wars is weird they want to be able to view the tree based on canonical and initial real life release time.
- Limitations: Cannot be bothered with searching through UIs forever and wants to get a clear overview and at best a text summary for their search parameters (AI???).

### Person I: (originator)
- Goal: Create original content and share it with the community.

### Person J: (chrooted creator)
