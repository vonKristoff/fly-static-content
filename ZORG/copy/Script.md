### the plains

* goals:
	* get out of there

contains a `barn` a `plain` a `forge` and a `mountain pass`, and a `basement` we start here on the pass face down in the mud having passed out for reason best left to the imagination (we have possibly shat ourselves also). (we may have to wash ourselves in a stream for our first non death experience)

we start on the high mountain pass, the trail ahead is blocked (needs to be added) the valleys are covered in pine trees strewn with the white rags of a dead cricket team or a dead KKK picnic, depends on the angle I guess.

we can go ~~`WEST`~~ (this should be `EAST` to the plain though). `WEST` is blocked by a boulder which needs to be removed.

to the wind swept plain, covered in piles of buffalo skulls and reeking of benson and hedges circa '83 and burnt grease.

here there is a football, useful for kicking and smashing things.

we can go north

to the barn, strewn with bottles and cobwebs, it stinks. on the east wall is a tempting window, it look oh so smash able. if we have a football we can kick it at the window to break it. this open the window allowing us to 

go to the `EAST` through the smashed window.

to the forge, the forge contains some petrol and matches, we can get those.

going back west into the barn we may notice some nice flammable hay. we can burn hay.

burn the hay and the barn down. yay. (we may have to leave the barn for a turn?).
once the fire goes out we can see a trapdoor where the hay bales once were.

we can go `DOWN` into the cellar where we can find some dynamite and some glue.

*glue has special powers, it allows us to travel through time and see the `other` world of the shitty 80's towns i grew up in fighting and losing and sometimes winning and nicking stuff and smoking tabs, sniffing glue, smoking soap bar dropping acid, taking speed and getting arrested etc*

glue will be important later.

we can now blow up the rock on the trail and go `EAST` to act 2

## act 2
### border town

goes over 2 timelines, one in 1870 ish and the other in the 1980's
1980's:
`off license`, `primary school`, `the park`, `primary school car park`, `art room`, `science room,`.
1860's:
`bar`, `livery stable`, `main street` `general store`, `back alley`, `brothel`, `bank`, `wagon dealership`

### 1860's - main street
we start on main street, filthy, muddy, small town pop about 250, probably a 100 if you include the territories, they've been making a big deal out of genocide and ignorance with a sparkle of religion.

you can go into the brothel, the bar, the general store or the apothecary, but you have no money and you'll get nowhere. you cant go into the bank. you can also go into the livery stable but it's empty other than flies and shit.

### 1860's - alley
down the alley is a drunk, rob his pockets to get shit stained but get a couple of dollars in loose change. also get the crisp bag that is incongruously lying around.

you can still go in anywhere other than the bank. but everywhere other than the bar throws you out if you haven't taken a bath.

### 1860's - bar
the bar sells baths. take a bath then buy a drink and the preacher will start to talk shit to you. 

this makes you really want to sniff glue or rather you can get a reminder that you have some glue in your pocket. evo stick. petroleum based.

if you have the crisp bag and the evo stick then you can glue sniff and wake up in the park in the 1980's. if not you die. also if you dont manage to get a bath within, I dunno 10 goes you die. if you keep drinking you die.

### 1980's - the park

you wake up in the park by priorswood primary there looks like there might be a way in to the school but you cant open the fence, you need some pliers.

andy taylor is in the park chucking rocks and cans and bottles in the river. he wants come cigs and he will show you how to get in if you give him cigs.

### off license

distract the shop keeper by asking for the sweets on the top shelf then you can reach over the counter and grab 10 bensons. if you get caught then death.
get fags.

### park
give fags to andy taylor and he will open the fence for you and then you can get into the school via the car park by the science room. there is a locked mini metro. 

kick the ball at some windows to get in to the art room/science room

### art room
here you can get glitter and scissors

### science room
in the desk are a set of keys. and some mints. get them.

### car park

steal the car, andy taylor will open the gate and you can drive out!. open the glove box and get more fags and a couple of cassettes. you now have the stereo. the stereo lets you use the hints tapes lying around in places. the stereo starts playing "in the air tonight", the stereo only play phil collins and dire straights and maybe chris de burgh or some other shite. we play music via `text-o-sonics` of course.

you black out.

### 1860's - livery stable

you wake up in a stall with a headache and the crisp bag jammed to your forehead. peel it off. there is now a horse. we shall call him ... horse 1. its yours. theres an angry dude yelling at you to fuck off in some language you cant speak. 

you can wander around, you still have some money, the bar will sell you drinks. but you need to go to the brothel. The bank wont let you in because the guard wont let you in.

### the brothel
there is the bank manager sitting at the bar. he wont talk to you.
you want to talk to Dusty who will tell you how to get some real money if you get her some opium. you need to steal the opium.

### general store

same trick as the fags, distract the dude palm the bottle of laudanum behind the counter?

### the brothel

give dusty the laudanum, she will tell you what to do, and give you the keys she has stolen from the manager whilst he is getting a happy meal.

dusty leaves. follow her. she takes the guard round the corner.

kick ball through the side window in the alley (same alley you found the drunk in) this gets you into the bank. find the safe. use the keys. get the cash.

go get your horse.

leave town on the horse to the sweet sweet sound of phil collins...
