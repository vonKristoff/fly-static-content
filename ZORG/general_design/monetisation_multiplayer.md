## possible monetisation

start rooms as `721`'s. 
players get a `start` room. this is unique to the player although it's the same set of portals, i.e. opens into the same world. later as they player "wins" we mint a new token for extra portals which attach to the players start room.
`rooms` can be tokens for start rooms.
`portals` can also be `721`'s

`portal` tokens get inter world capabilities. some you pay for some you get as prizes.

prizes you get for completing levels etc.

maybe levels themselves are also `721`'s which allows for players/authors to mint their own `chapter`/`level` and players wold then need to mint a `start` room there.

i guess one could have a `master` token which allows a whole world mint. 

## multiplayer modes

initial thoughts. each player has their own contract (see the start room thing) so therefore access to world is controlled to that `start` BUT as multiple players can be playing their "individual" worlds we run it as a kind of season. i.e. a start date to each campaign.

when you play depending on where you are in the timeline of the campaign you can get a replay of what other players did in the rooms to solve for getting to the next set of rooms.

if you are playing along and other players are also playing in their own `room` then you can see a brief description of stuff... "garbleblfian picked up a ball" etc.

you get better `prizes` if you solve without this. or something

## competition modes

who gets to the `end` fastest, solves more puzzles.
who can make the `best portal` i.e. a `start` room that people enjoy playing the most then the `author` wins. 

## start room/player tokens
this represent an individual player. it always starts with the same set of portals ??

when players "level up" they can start to change the portals. i.e they can add rooms to their start tokens portals

## general tokens

objects that have actions can also be owned and perhaps should be adde to the inventory token.

svg generated from state of player how well they are doing/health this goes onto the player token, when they are doing well then the picture is better.

## inventories

these can belong and sort of do belong to a player, they could be swapped.

## parser tokens (semantic)

perhaps a verb should in fact be a 721 itself
