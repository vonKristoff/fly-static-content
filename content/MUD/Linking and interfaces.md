the `world` contract must handle the linking of the interfaces and this has to somehow ties into a deploy/codegen step

the IWorld interface actually I think that includes the interfaces

so then how would one do this with deployed contracts? because the higher level stuff or at the calling stuff needs to know the address of the Interfaces implementing contract to use it.
